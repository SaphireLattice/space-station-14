# Licensing configuration file

# Used by `Tools/rga_check.py` for making sure that all assets have attribution, valid licenses,
# that custom licenses have their files properly recorded, and various other asset compliance checks


# Flag that designates the project as non-commercial and stops the script from screaming about license violation
# Make sure to flip this off if you're unsure about commerciality of your project
# This is purely for own checking of assets in your project
project_is_non_commercial_and_not_for_profit: true


# Checks to ignore for running the script without other parameters
# Useful if you want to ensure linting in CI, but can't turn on full compliance checking yet
# See ValidationFailure enum for values
ignore_checks:
- SOURCE_UNKNOWN
- UNATTRIBUTED


# If you want to make sure certain licenses are treated as invalid even though the project is non-commercial
# invalid_licenses:
# - "WTFPL" # Not actually allowed by the rga_validator check, but here as an example
# - "CC-BY-NC-3.0"
# - "CC-BY-NC-4.0"
# - "CC-BY-NC-SA-3.0"
